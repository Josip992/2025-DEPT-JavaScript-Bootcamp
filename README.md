Task description: Create a React application that will fetch random colors and allow the user to save desired colors in a color palette.

The application should be behind a login. Use the credentials with which you registered before to log in. 

Create a page that will allow a user to fetch random colors and save them in their color palette.

Using GET bootcamp2025.depster.me/api/colors fetch a list of random colors. The API returns 1 at minimum, 10 at most. You can control the request with the "limit" query param.

When an authenticated user clicks a button to fetch colors, the app should fetch random colors and display them in a grid.

Each color should be displayed as a square with a background color and a hex code.

There should be an option to save the color to the user's color palette.

The color palette should be displayed in a separate section of the page.

There should be an option to remove the color from the palette.

The color palette should be saved in the browser's local storage.
